# 💎 Manzarri: A Full-Stack E-commerce Solution for the Jewellery Market

## Project Overview

**Manzarri** is a robust, full-stack e-commerce platform specializing in the **jewellery market**. The project was conceived and developed during an intensive **seven-day hackathon**, with the core objective of creating a deployable application supported by a solid business model. Leveraging a background in family retail, the developer identified a need to build a high-quality online storefront that could compete in a differentiated niche.

The initial concept was a clothing store, but recognizing high market saturation among other hackathon participants (approx. 70%), a strategic pivot was executed to focus on the **gold and fine jewellery market**. This decision prioritized **business coherence** and competitive differentiation.
